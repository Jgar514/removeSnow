Remove Snow Blackline Contracting is a general contractor that provides snow removal services during winter months. The company comprises of five general managers who subcontract the work to various companies and crews. Blackline Contracting has contracts with commercial properties throughout the area and strives to increase its labor resources every year.

When a snowstorm hits, the company distributes a binder to each sub-contractor containing all the locations, not just their specific assignments. After the storm, each individual submits a form for each instance of work performed at each property. However, this often results in hundreds of crumpled and possibly inaccurate reports. It's possible that someone involved in labor-intensive work may have forgotten or lost a form along the way.

Business Need The system that the company developed seems to create a lot of stress and disorganization. To keep track of all the properties they have contracts with, they would put laminated pages in binders. However, with the number of subcontractors needing this information, it resulted in a lot of binders and laminated pages. So, each snow removal crew has a binder with 30 or so locations, and they flip through to find the three or four they are assigned to.

After the storm, each sub-contractor/snow crew has to turn in a piece of paper asking for:

How long they were at the property How many bags of salt they used How much brine they used in gallons What the weather conditions were during their time at that property

The way the snow storm work is usually done means leaving to go to another property and returning multiple times. A snowstorm is a long, ongoing battle for the snowplow crews. So, after the 20-hour-long shift comes to an end, the crews show up cold and exhausted and have to turn in 15 pieces of paper each. The office administrator and the owner have to hope all the correct information was turned in, as paper reports would be missing or destroyed from getting wet.

The process of getting everyone paid and getting the correct payment from customers was a whole other storm in itself that eventually had to be passed to the owner's wife in an attempt to make sense of it all.

Solution Although laminated pages were once a sign of class in the past, we wanted to move to a digital system. To achieve this, we used Mendix to create a database where we could enter and store information about contract locations, scope of work, active tasks. With upcoming features such as hour tracking and report generating.

Mendix allowed us to have a responsive design that could be used by an office administrator to actively manage a snow storm as it happened. We also are setting up a mobile version that provided specific functionality to the foot soldiers working the storm, giving them access to the information they need and the ability to generate their own reports.

Mendix made it easy to implement effective tools, such as widgets for displaying information and API integration, like the one offered by Google Maps. The most useful aspect of using Mendix was being able to hear the challenges faced by our customers and then quickly create a working solution that could be shown to the customer and built upon.

Results After quickly developing a functional app that addressed some of the customer's needs, we received their feedback within the first week of starting. This allowed the customer to express their preferences after seeing some of their issues addressed.

As a result, we planned to integrate a time-tracking software to pay workers based on their roles during a snowstorm.

Additionally, we brainstormed the idea of automatically generating reports, which we will be implementing with an option to automatically input hours and weather conditions during a specific time.
